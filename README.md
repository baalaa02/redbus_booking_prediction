# redbus_booking_prediction
 For the redBus DataDecode 2025 hackathon, I built a model to forecast final seat bookings 15 days in advance using historical transaction and search data. I merged, cleaned, and feature-engineered the datasets, then trained a Random Forest Regressor on route-level and date-level patterns. The final predictions were rounded for submission.
